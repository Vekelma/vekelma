## Hi, I’m Vekelma 👋

I’m a Roblox developer focused on building clean and understandable gameplay systems.
I enjoy working on modular designs and improving systems step by step while keeping code readable and organized.

I’m currently available for small to medium commission work.

## 💼 What I Can Help With

- Gameplay mechanics (abilities, movement, cooldown systems)
- Modular Lua systems
- Client–server logic separation
- Improving or extending existing systems
- Debugging and cleanup of scripts

I focus on making systems **stable, readable, and easy to work with**.

## 📌 Past Projects

### Modular Ability System
A gameplay system that manages per-player ability cooldowns and executes abilities through independent modules.

**Highlights:**
- Centralized cooldown handling
- Separate ability execution (Dash, etc.)
- Clean structure for extending abilities
- Designed with commission use in mind

This project shows how I structure systems and think about maintainability.
